# QuizScope
QuizScope is a 3D First-Person-Shooter game I made in 2020.

To play the game, download files and then run 'QuizScope.exe' file.

Languages and Tools used:
- Unity 3D
- C#
- Royalty free 3D models and packages

I used C# with object-oriented principles to support the game mechanics. Scripts written in C# can be found in the 'Scripts' folder.

Feel free to discuss this project with me further, I will be thrilled to answer any questions.
