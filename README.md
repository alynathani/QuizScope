# QuizScope
QuizScope is a 3D First-Person-Shooter game I made in 2020.

My general idea behind the concept of this game is the blending of education and gaming. Essentially, it displays a quiz to players, but to answer a question, the player has to shoot a correctly-coloured balloon which corresponds to the correct answer to the question. There is a point system and contains three themes of questions which the player can choose from.

To play the game, download files and then run the 'QuizScope.exe' file. I recommend doing this by downloading the project zip file, and then running the exe file once files have been extracted to a folder.

Languages and Tools used:
- Unity 3D
- C#
- Royalty free 3D models and packages

I used C# with object-oriented principles to support the game mechanics. Scripts written in C# can be found in the 'Scripts' folder.

Feel free to discuss this project with me further, I will be thrilled to answer any questions.
